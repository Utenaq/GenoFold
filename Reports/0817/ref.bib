abstract = {Recent experiments and simulations have demonstrated that proteins can fold on the ribosome, but the importance of co-translational folding for the fitness of an organism remains an open question. Here we report a genome-wide analysis that uncovers evidence of evolutionary selection for co-translational folding. We describe a robust statistical approach to identify conserved loci within genes that are significantly enriched in slowly translated codons. Surprisingly, we find that domain boundaries can explain only a small fraction of these conserved loci. Instead, we propose that regions enriched in slowly translated codons are associated with co-translational folding intermediates, which may be smaller than a single domain. We show that the intermediates predicted by a native-centric model of co-translational folding account for the majority of these loci across more than 500 E. coli proteins. By making a direct connection to protein folding, this analysis provides strong evidence that many synonymous substitutions have been selected to optimize translation rates at specific locations within genes. More generally, our results indicate that kinetics, and not just thermodynamics, can significantly alter the efficiency of self-assembly in a biological context.},

Applications to E. Coli. SRP RNA and pbuE riboswitch indicate that the model may provide reliable predictions for the cotranscriptional folding pathways and population kinetics. For E. Coli. SRP RNA, the predicted population kinetics and the folding pathway are consistent with the SHAPE profiles in the recent cotranscriptional SHAPE-seq experiments. For the pbuE riboswitch, the model predicts the transcriptional termination efficiency as a function of the force. The theoretical results show (a) a force-induced transition from the aptamer (antiterminator) to the terminator structure and (b) the different folding pathways for the riboswitch with and without the ligand (adenine).

abstract = {A procedure for simulating the RNA folding process using the principles of genetic algorithm is proposed. The method allows one to simulate a folding pathway of RNA, including such processes as disruption of temporarily formed structures, the folding of a molecule during its synthesis and pseudoknot formation. The simulations are able to predict functional metastable foldings and kinetically driven transitions to more stable structures. The analysis of free energies for intermediate foldings allows estimation of the ranges of kinetic refolding barriers and suggests that in some RNAs the selective evolutionary pressure suppresses the possibilities for alternative structures that could form in the course of transcription. It is shown that the folding pathway simulation can result in structure predictions that are more consistent with phylogenetically proven structures than minimum energy solutions. This suggest that RNA folding kinetics is very important for the formation of functional RNA structures. Therefore, apart form its value for predictions of RNA structures, the proposed computer simulations can be a powerful tool in the studies of RNA folding features. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press Limited.},

According to KPM a small fraction of molecules folds rapidly to the native state whereas the remaining fraction is kinetically trapped in a low free-energy non-native state. This model provides a unified description of the way RNA and proteins fold. Single-molecule experiments on Tetrahymena ribozyme, which directly validate our theory, are analyzed using KPM. We also describe the earliest events that occur on microsecond time scales in RNA folding. These must involve collapse of RNA molecules that are mediated by counterion-condensation. Estimates of time scales for the initial events in RNA folding are provided for the Tetrahymena ribozyme.},

Although linear algebra provides an exact computational solution of secondary structure folding kinetics with respect to the Turner energy model for tiny ({\~{}} 20 nt) RNA sequences, the folding kinetics for larger sequences can only be approximated by binning structures into macrostates in a coarse-grained model, or by repeatedly simulating secondary structure folding with either the Monte Carlo algorithm or the Gillespie algorithm. Here we investigate the relation between the Monte Carlo algorithm and the Gillespie algorithm. We prove that asymptotically, the expected time for a K-step trajectory of the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to {\textless}N{\textgreater} times that of the Gillespie algorithm, where {\textless}N{\textgreater} denotes the Boltzmann expected network degree. If the network is regular (i.e. every node has the same degree), then the mean first passage time (MFPT) computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to MFPT computed by the Gillespie algorithm multiplied by {\textless}N{\textgreater}; however, this is not true for non-regular networks. In particular, RNA secondary structure folding kinetics, as computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm, is not equal to the folding kinetics, as computed by the Gillespie algorithm, although the mean first passage times are roughly correlated. Simulation software for RNA secondary structure folding according to the Monte Carlo and Gille- spie algorithms is publicly available, as is our software to compute the expected degree of the net- work of secondary structures of a given RNA sequence {\{} see http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clote/ RNAexpNumNbors.}},

abstract = {Despite considerable efforts, no physical mechanism has been shown to explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes. Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base pairing with the SD sequence. Our results provide general physical insights into the coding-level features that optimize protein expression in prokaryotes. Bacterial genes tend to have more rare codons in the N terminus. Bhattacharyya et al. show that synonymous substitutions in the N terminus sequester the ribosome binding site and prevent translation initiation, thereby affecting both mRNA and protein levels. Such effects strongly depend on the transcribing RNA polymerase.},

Water filling is strongly cooperative, with the possible coexistence of filled and empty states and sensitivity to small perturbations of the pore polarity and solvent conditions. Confined water molecules form tightly hydrogen-bonded wires or clusters. The weak attractions to the confining wall, combined with strong interactions between water molecules, permit exceptionally rapid water flow, exceeding expectations from macroscopic hydrodynamics by several orders of magnitude. The proton mobility along 1D water wires also substantially exceeds that in the bulk. Proteins appear to exploit these unusual properties of confined water in their biological function (e.g., to ensure rapid water flow in aquaporins or to gate proton flow in proton pumps and enzymes). The unusual properties of water in nonpolar confinement are also relevant to the design of novel nanofluidic and molecular separation devices or fuel cells.},

From a computational biology point of view, secondary structures have a special role because they can be computed efficiently using exact dynamic programming algorithms.

The consistency between the thermodynamics of this coupling and the microscopic reversibility of the underlying molecular dynamics is investigated. For this purpose coupled Langevin equations for the translational, rotational, and chemical fluctuations of self-phoretic motors are derived. A mechanochemical fluctuation theorem for the joint probability to find the motor at position r after n reactive events have occurred during the time interval t is also derived. An important result that follows from this analysis is the identification of an effect that is reciprocal to self-propulsion by diffusiophoresis, which leads to the possibility of fuel synthesis by mechanochemical coupling to external force and torque.},

Long, structured 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) are commonly found in bacterial mRNAs, though the physical mechanisms that determine how the ribosome binds these upstream regions remain poorly defined. Here, we systematically investigate the ribosome's interactions with structured standby sites, upstream of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and show that these interactions can modulate translation initiation rates by over 100-fold. We find that an mRNA's translation initiation rate is controlled by the amount of single-stranded surface area, the partial unfolding of RNA structures to minimize the ribosome's binding free energy penalty, the absence of cooperative binding and the potential for ribosomal sliding. We develop a biophysical model employing thermodynamic first principles and a four-parameter free energy model to accurately predict the ribosome's translation initiation rates for 136 synthetic 5' UTRs with large structures, diverse shapes and multiple standby site modules. The model predicts and experiments confirm that the ribosome can readily bind distant standby site modules that support high translation rates, providing a physical mechanism for observed context effects and long-range post-transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at non-uniform speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can affect a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the messenger RNA. Thus, redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of translational pausing in bacteria by ribosome profiling--deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This approach enables the high-resolution measurement of ribosome density profiles along most transcripts at unperturbed, endogenous expression levels. Unexpectedly, we found that codons decoded by rare transfer RNAs do not lead to slow translation under nutrient-rich conditions. Instead, Shine-Dalgarno-(SD)-like features within coding sequences cause pervasive translational pausing. Using an orthogonal ribosome possessing an altered anti-SD sequence, we show that pausing is due to hybridization between the mRNA and 16S ribosomal RNA of the translating ribosome. In protein-coding sequences, internal SD sequences are disfavoured, which leads to biased usage, avoiding codons and codon pairs that resemble canonical SD sites. Our results indicate that internal SD-like sequences are a major determinant of translation rates and a global driving force for the coding of bacterial genomes.},

We find that an mRNA's translation initiation rate is controlled by the amount of single-stranded surface area, the partial unfolding of RNA structures to minimize the ribosome's binding free energy penalty, the absence of cooperative binding and the potential for ribosomal sliding. We develop a biophysical model employing thermodynamic first principles and a four-parameter free energy model to accurately predict the ribosome's translation initiation rates for 136 synthetic 5' UTRs with large structures, diverse shapes and multiple standby site modules. The model predicts and experiments confirm that the ribosome can readily bind distant standby site modules that support high translation rates, providing a physical mechanism for observed context effects and long-range post-transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at non-uniform speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can affect a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the messenger RNA. Thus, redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of translational pausing in bacteria by ribosome profiling--deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This approach enables the high-resolution measurement of ribosome density profiles along most transcripts at unperturbed, endogenous expression levels. Unexpectedly, we found that codons decoded by rare transfer RNAs do not lead to slow translation under nutrient-rich conditions. Instead, Shine-Dalgarno-(SD)-like features within coding sequences cause pervasive translational pausing. Using an orthogonal ribosome possessing an altered anti-SD sequence, we show that pausing is due to hybridization between the mRNA and 16S ribosomal RNA of the translating ribosome. In protein-coding sequences, internal SD sequences are disfavoured, which leads to biased usage, avoiding codons and codon pairs that resemble canonical SD sites. Our results indicate that internal SD-like sequences are a major determinant of translation rates and a global driving force for the coding of bacterial genomes.},

abstract = {A goal in the kinetic characterization of a macromolecular system is the description of its slow relaxation processes via (i) identification of the structural changes involved in these processes and (ii) estimation of the rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the "slow subspace" of a large set of prior order parameters - either generic internal coordinates or a user-defined set of parameters. Using a variational formulation of conformational dynamics, it is shown that an existing method-the time-lagged independent component analysis-provides the optional solution to this problem. In addition, optimal indicators-order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates-are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue intrinsically disordered peptide kinase inducible domain (KID). The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful method for investigating the structural stability, dynamics, and function of biopolymers at the atomic level. In recent years, it has become possible to perform simulations on time scales of the order of milliseconds using special hardware. However, it is necessary to derive the important factors contributing to structural change or function from the complicated movements of biopolymers obtained from long simulations. Although some analysis methods for protein systems have been developed using increasing simulation times, many of these methods are static in nature (i.e., no information on time). In recent years, dynamic analysis methods have been developed, such as the Markov state model and relaxation mode analysis (RMA), which was introduced based on spin and homopolymer systems. The RMA method approximately extracts slow relaxation modes and rates from trajectories and decomposes the structural fluctuations into slow relaxation modes, which characterize the slow relaxation dynamics of the system. Recently, this method has been applied to biomolecular systems. In this article, we review RMA and its improved versions for protein systems.},

These models can provide a human-comprehensible picture of the underlying process, and have been successfully used to study protein folding, protein aggregation, protein ligand binding, and other biophysical systems. The MSM requires the construction of a discrete state-space such that two points are in the same state if they can interconvert rapidly. In the following, we suggest an improved method, which utilizes second order Independent Components Analysis (also known as time-structure based Independent Components Analysis, or tICA), to construct the state-space. We apply this method to simulations of NTL9 (provided by Lindorff-Larsen et al.

Additionally, the resulting model provides insight into the role of non-native contacts by revealing many slow timescales associated with compact, non-native states.},

abstract = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

Here, we investigate using molecular dynamics simulations dynamical properties of the water confined in hydrophilic protein–protein and protein–DNA interfaces. We find that the interfacial water exhibits glassy slow relaxations even at 300 K. In particular, the rotational dynamics show a logarithmic decay that was observed in glass-forming liquids at deeply supercooled states. We argue that such slow water dynamics are indeed induced by the hydrophilic binding surfaces, which is in opposition to the picture that the hydration water slaves protein motions.

Structures were calculated for each protein using published NMR restraints. In addition, structures were calculated for BPTI using artificial restraints generated from a high-resolution crystal structure. In all cases the fittest calculated structures were close to the target structure, and could be refined to structures indistinguishable from the target structures by means of a low-temperature simulated annealing refinement. The effectiveness of the program is similar to that of distance geometry and simulated annealing methods, and it is capable of using a very wide range of restraints as input. It can thus be readily extended to the calculation of structures of large proteins, for which few NOE restraints may be available.},

The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds.

We point out an inconsistency in the standard approach to RNA secondary structure prediction for large molecules. Under an external force a second-order phase transition between a globular and an extended phase takes place. A Harris-type criterion shows that sequence disorder does not affect the correlation length exponent while the other critical exponents are modified in the glass phase. However, at high temperatures, on a coarse-grained level, disordered RNA is well described by a homogeneous model. The characteristics of force-extension curves are discussed as a function of the energy parameters. We show that the force transition is always second order.

Define MS2 distance between secondary structures s and t to be the minimum path length to refold s to t, where a move from MS2 is applied in each step. We describe algorithms to compute the shortest MS2 folding trajectory between any two given RNA secondary structures. These algorithms include an optimal integer programming (IP) algorithm, an accurate and efficient near-optimal algorithm, a greedy algorithm, a branch-and-bound algorithm, and an optimal algorithm if one allows intermediate structures to contain pseudoknots. Our optimal IP [resp. near-optimal IP] algorithm maximizes [resp. approximately maximizes] the number of shifts and minimizes [resp. approximately minimizes] the number of base pair additions and removals by applying integer programming to (essentially) solve the minimum feedback vertex set (FVS) problem for the RNA conflict digraph, then applies topological sort to tether subtrajectories into the final optimal folding trajectory. We prove NP-hardness of the problem to determine the minimum barrier energy over all possible MS2 folding pathways, and conjecture that computing the MS2 distance between arbitrary secondary structures is NP-hard. Since our optimal IP algorithm relies on the FVS, known to be NP-complete for arbitrary digraphs, we compare the family of RNA conflict digraphs with the following classes of digraphs (planar, reducible flow graph, Eulerian, and tournament) for which FVS is known to be either polynomial time computable or NP-hard.

We introduce a new mechanism, called “ribosome drafting”, that explains how a mRNA's folding kinetics and the ribosome's binding rate collectively control its translation initiation rate. During cycles of translation, ribosome drafting emerges whenever successive ribosomes bind to a mRNA faster than the mRNA can refold, maintaining it in a nonequilibrium state with an acceleration of protein synthesis. Using computational design, time-correlated single photon counting, and expression measurements, we demonstrate that slow-folding and fast-folding RNA structures with equivalent folding energetics can vary protein synthesis rates by 1000-fold.

abstract = {Our ability to predict protein expression from DNA sequence alone remains poor, reflecting our limited understanding of cis-regulatory grammar and hampering the design of engineered genes for synthetic biology applications. Here, we generate a model that predicts the protein expression of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a library of half a million 50-nucleotide-long random 5' UTRs and assayed their activity in a massively parallel growth selection experiment. The resulting data allow us to quantify the impact on protein expression of Kozak sequence composition, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), and secondary structure. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the random library and showed that it performs well at predicting the protein expression of both a held-out set of the random 5' UTRs as well as native S. cerevisiae 5' UTRs. The model additionally was used to computationally evolve highly active 5' UTRs. We confirmed experimentally that the great majority of the evolved sequences led to higher protein expression rates than the starting sequences, demonstrating the predictive power of this model.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a strategy for reducing a complex single molecule kinetic process to a set of generic structures (motifs) that are building blocks for a general kinetic scheme. In general, these motifs have complex kinetics (i.e., waiting time distribution functions) which are composed of fundamental kinetic steps. (1) First, we treat four different experimental single molecule measurements within both the usual kinetic framework (i.e., using the rate matrix) and the waiting time distribution function framework. The two frameworks are then shown to be equivalent and can be formulated on the basis of the first passage time distribution function of monitored single molecule events. (2) Second, to calculate this basic quantity, we decompose a complex kinetic scheme with the help of two kinetic motifs, sequential and branching, and derive self-consistent equations by convoluting waiting time distributions and first passage time distribution(s) along the reaction pathway(s). (3) As examples, two experimental systems, a chain reaction model with a special case of enzymatic reactions and a general kinetic model for fluorescence emission, are analyzed on the basis of a generic scheme composed of a monitored link, controlled link, and unknown link, each representing a possible subscheme associated with a complex waiting time distribution function. As a result, single molecule measurements of the generic scheme retain the same functional form when a kinetic link is altered within a subscheme, and different measurements can be classified and analyzed within the same framework. (4) Finally, to explore the physical reasons for nonexponential waiting time distribution, we use the example of blinking phenomena to discuss several scenarios of dynamic and static disorder and their implications for observed memory effects. The self-consistent pathway formalism is presented in this paper for renewal processes and will be generalized to nonrenewal processes with memory effects in a future publication. I.},

abstract = {Many enzymatic reactions in biochemistry are far more complex than the celebrated Michaelis−Menten scheme, but the observed turnover rate often obeys the hyperbolic dependence on the substrate concentration, a relation established almost a century ago for the simple Michaelis−Menten mechanism. To resolve the longstanding puzzle, we apply the flux balance method to predict the functional form of the substrate dependence in the mean turnover time of complex enzymatic reactions and identify detailed balance (i.e., the lack of unbalanced conformtional current) as a sufficient condition for the Michaelis−Menten equation to describe the substrate concentration dependence of the turnover rate in an enzymatic network. This prediction can be verified in single-molecule event-averaged measurements using the recently proposed signatures of detailed balance violations. The finding helps analyze recent single-molecule studies of enzymatic networks and can be applied to other external variables, such as force-dependenc...},

Here, we report the results of single-molecule fluorescence studies that characterize the ligand-dependent cotranscriptional folding of the Escherichia coli thiM riboswitch that regulates translation. We found that the riboswitch aptamer folds into the "off" conformation independent of its ligand, but switches to the "on" conformation during transcriptional pausing near the translational start codon. Ligand binding maintains the riboswitch in the off conformation during transcriptional pauses. We expect our assay will permit the controlled study of the two main physical mechanisms that regulate cotranscriptional folding: transcriptional pausing and transcriptional speed.},

The current release of RMBase includes ∼9500 pseudouridine ($\Psi$) modifications generated from Pseudo-seq and CeU-seq sequencing data, ∼1000 5-methylcytosines (m(5)C) predicted from Aza-IP data, ∼124 200 N6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) modifications discovered from m(6)A-seq and ∼1210 2'-O-methylations (2'-O-Me) identified from RiboMeth-seq data and public resources. Moreover, RMBase provides a comprehensive listing of other experimentally supported types of RNA modifications by integrating various resources. It provides web interfaces to show thousands of relationships between RNA modification sites and microRNA target sites. It can also be used to illustrate the disease-related SNPs residing in the modification sites/regions. RMBase provides a genome browser and a web-based modTool to query, annotate and visualize various RNA modifications.

In metazoans the genes that encode these proteins produce mRNAs that, instead of being polyadenylated, contain a unique 3' end structure. By contrast, the synthesis of the variant, replication-independent histones, which are encoded by polyadenylated mRNAs, persists outside of S phase. Accurate positioning of both histone types in chromatin is essential for proper transcriptional regulation, the demarcation of heterochromatic boundaries and the epigenetic inheritance of gene expression patterns. Recent results suggest that the coordinated synthesis of replication-dependent and variant histone mRNAs is achieved by signals that affect formation of the 3' end of the replication-dependent histone mRNAs.},

abstract = {The 5'-cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA is methylated at the terminal guanosine by RNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase (cap MTase). Saccharomyces cerevisiae ABD1 (ScABD1) and human hMet (also called CMT1) genes are responsible for this enzyme. The ABD1 homologue was cloned from the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans and named C. albicans ABD1 (CaABD1). When expressed as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST), CaAbd1p displayed cap MTase activity in vitro and rescued S. cerevisiae abd1delta null mutants, indicating that CaABD1 specifies an active cap MTase. Although the human cap MTase binds to the human capping enzyme (Hce1p), which possesses both mRNA guanylyltransferase (mRNA GTase) and mRNA 5'-triphosphatase (mRNA TPase) activities, yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that in yeast neither mRNA GTase nor mRNA TPase physically interacted with the Abd1 protein. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of known and putative cap MTases revealed a highly conserved amino acid sequence motif, Phe/Val-Leu-Asp/Glu-Leu/Met-Xaa-Cys-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly-Asp-Leu-Xaa-Lys, which encompasses the sequence motif characteristic of divergent methyltransferases. Mutations in CaAbd1p of leucine at the second and the twelfth positions (so far uncharacterized) to alanine severely diminished the enzyme activity and the functionality in vivo, whereas those of leucine at the fourth, cysteine at the sixth, lysine at the eighth, and glycine at the tenth positions did not. Furthermore, valine substitution for the twelfth, but not for the second, leucine in that motif abolished the activity and functionality of CaAbd1p. Thus, it appears that leucine at the second and the twelfth positions in the motif, together with a previously identified acidic residue in the third, glycine at the sixth and glutamic acid at the eleventh positions, play important roles in the catalysis, and that side chain length is crucial for the activity at the twelfth position in the motif.},

abstract = {Motivated by the analysis of natural and engineered DNA and RNA systems, we present the first algorithm for calculating the partition function of an unpseudoknotted complex of multiple interacting nucleic acid strands. This dynamic program is based on a rigorous extension of secondary structure models to the multistranded case, addressing representation and distinguishability issues that do not arise for single-stranded structures. We then derive the form of the partition function for a fixed volume containing a dilute solution of nucleic acid complexes. This expression can be evaluated explicitly for small numbers of strands, allowing the calculation of the equilibrium population distribution for each species of complex. Alternatively, for large systems (e.g., a test tube), we show that the unique complex concentrations corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium can be obtained by solving a convex programming problem. Partition function and concentration information can then be used to calculate equilibrium base-pairing observables. The underlying physics and mathematical formulation of these problems lead to an interesting blend of approaches, including ideas from graph theory, group theory, dynamic programming, combinatorics, convex optimization, and Lagrange duality.},

@article{Best2018,
abstract = {In contrast to other biopolymers such as RNA, most foldable protein sequences have a single, unique native structure, which is the most stable conforma-tion. Understanding this remarkable property has been the long-held goal of protein folding research (1, 2). Once folded, proteins will undergo transitions between different conformational states within the na-tive free-energy basin, often associated with their func-tion; however, in most cases, these can be thought of as only local changes or deformations of structure that do not change the overall fold. On the other hand, a small number of proteins have been identified in which a more profound rearrangement of the fold can occur, with the most extreme examples being protein se-quences that can switch to a completely different folded state as a function of environmental conditions or ligand binding (3). An example in which a subtle change of fold is used for functional regulation is found in the serine protease inhibitor family known as serpins. In this case, it appears that the initially formed " native " structure is not the thermodynamically most stable fold. In PNAS, Rao and Gosavi (4) investigate the origin of this kinetically controlled folding for a prototypical serpin, $\alpha$1-antitrypsin. Serpins are an abundant type of protease inhibitor, most commonly inhibiting chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (5) by a suicide mechanism: The protein initially folds to an active, inhibitory fold (Fig. 1, Top Left) in which the exposed reactive center loop (RCL) serves as a recognition motif for proteases. Binding of the protease results in cleavage of the RCL loop and covalent linkage of the serpin to the protease. At the same time, the remainder of the RCL loop inserts into a $\beta$-sheet in the serpin structure. Interestingly, a similar uncleaved " latent " fold with an inserted RCL sequence also exists (Fig. 1, Bottom Left) and, moreover, is more thermodynamically stable than the inhibitory fold. How-ever, the inhibitory structure is formed first, presumably because it is under kinetic control. Some serpins, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, can also spontane-ously convert from the inhibitory form to the latent form (dashed arrow in Fig. 1), providing yet another mode of regulation. The fascinating complexity of the serpin in-hibition mechanism has been illuminated by the success of experimental structural biology in identifying many of the stable states populated by these proteins (including the examples shown in Fig. 1 and more) (5). In addition, equilibrium and kinetic folding studies have indicated the formation of a stable folding intermediate on the folding pathways of serpins, including $\alpha$1-antitrypsin (6). Nonetheless, ensemble experiments can only probe stable or metastable states, and not the detailed mechanisms for their interconversion. Filling in these gaps is the natural domain of theory and simulation, although the problem is still challenging owing to the time scales involved. An excellent example is the above-mentioned spontane-ous conversion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 from the inhibitory form to the latent form, a process that occurs on a time scale of hours. By using a recently developed path-sampling algorithm, the mechanism of this transition could be studied in recent all-atom sim-ulations, with results very consistent with experimental changes of rate obtained for mutants (7). Many mechanistic questions about serpin folding and conformational transitions remain. Foremost among these is why the active, inhibitory form wins the initial race to the native (inhibitory) state over the thermodynamically more stable latent form. Rao and Gosavi (4) now address this question using a structure-based, coarse-grained model in which the only resi-due pairs with attractive interactions are those formed in a given target structure. Such models are motivated by the energy landscape theory of protein folding, which posits that the folding free-energy landscape is funneled toward a single native state (8–11). While such a model may at first seem inconsistent with the folding scenario of serpins, it allows direct folding to the alternative latent structure to be studied, without the competing inhibitory fold. By computing separate folding free-energy landscapes for the inhibitory and latent structures, the authors found a free-energy bar-rier for folding to the latent form that was significantly higher (by ∼4 k B T). An important consideration in comparing free-energy barriers is relative stabilities, considering that the latent form is more stable and stabilizing a protein tends to lower its folding barrier. In the context of the simulation model, it could be shown that the latent form would have to be ∼13 k B T more stable than the inhibitory form for the folding barriers to be comparable. The lower barrier for folding to the inhibitory form appears to be the conse-quence of a metastable on-pathway intermediate in which a domain consisting of the B-C $\beta$-barrel is folded, while the remainder of the protein is not. This intermediate is in accord with most experimental data reflecting the folding equilibrium and kinetics for this protein and other serpins (5). The latent form folds instead via a single tran-sition state, with some similarities to the above intermediate, but in which key $\beta$-strand contacts with the RCL are already formed very early. The authors have proposed that this mechanism could be tested by engineering disulfide bonds that lock in these contacts, and thus favor formation of the latent state. The simulations described above have addressed the left-hand side of the diagram in Fig. 1, namely, folding of and spontaneous conversion between the inhibitory and latent forms. From a folding perspective, this is elegant because all these steps involve the en-ergy landscape of the same unbroken protein chain. However, the functional energy landscape of a serpin includes additional steps: interaction with a protease, cleavage of the RCL, covalent linkage of the serpin to the protease, and conversion of the cleaved protease to the inactive form, with a structure similar to the latent form. An interesting future mechanistic question for simulation is how the cleavage of the RCL is coupled to the structural conversion of the serpin fold to the inactive state. While such a problem would be difficult to study with standard topology-based models, so-called dual-topology models can accommodate alternative stable states (12–14), allowing the coupling between bond cleavage and confor-mational transitions to be studied directly in a simulation model. Another interesting aspect of serpins are serinopathy diseases, characterized by formation of pathological polymers of these pro-teins (ref. 15, also hinted at in ref. 4). The identification of a domain-swapped serpin dimer structure suggests a potential mechanism for head-to-tail polymerization (16) (Fig. 1F). In this structure, each pro-tein swaps one $\beta$-hairpin (involving the RCL) with the other; were the exchange not mutual, such interactions could be used to form a chain of serpin molecules. If polymerization indeed occurs by do-main swapping, it should also be possible to study the mechanism using simulations with structure-based models (17, 18). There is thus rich potential for theory and simulation to provide further in-sights into the mechanisms of serpin folding, inhibitory function, misfolding, and polymerization. Acknowledgments},

The F(C), in contrast to the F(H), is shown to be invariant with respect to arbitrary transformations of the reaction coordinate, which makes possible partition of configuration space into basins in an invariant way. A "natural coordinate," for which F(H) and F(C) differ by a multiplicative constant (constant diffusion coefficient), is introduced. The approach is illustrated by a model one-dimensional system, the alanine dipeptide, and the folding reaction of a double beta-hairpin miniprotein. It is shown how the results can be used to test whether the putative reaction coordinate is a good reaction coordinate.},

abstract = {Biological processes are carried out through molecular conformational transitions, ranging from the structural changes within biomolecules to the formation of macromolecular complexes and the associations between the complexes themselves. These transitions cover a vast range of timescales and are governed by a tangled network of molecular interactions. The resulting hierarchy of interactions, in turn, becomes encoded in the experimentally-measurable "mechanical fingerprints" of the biomolecules, their force-extension curves. However, how can we decode these fingerprints so that they reveal the kinetic barriers and the associated timescales of a biological process? Here, we show that this can be accomplished with a simple, model-free transformation that is general enough to be applicable to molecular interactions involving an arbitrarily large number of kinetic barriers. Specifically, the transformation converts the mechanical fingerprints of the system directly into a map of force-dependent rate constants. This map reveals the kinetics of the multitude of rate processes in the system beyond what is typically accessible to direct measurements. With the contributions from individual barriers to the interaction network now "untangled", the map is straightforward to analyze in terms of the prominent barriers and timescales. Practical implementation of the transformation is illustrated with simulated biomolecular interactions that comprise different patterns of complexity-from a cascade of activation barriers to competing dissociation pathways.},

abstract = {Continuous-time random walks (CTRWs) on discrete state spaces, ranging from regular lattices to complex networks, are ubiquitous across physics, chemistry, and biology. Models with coarse-grained states, for example those in Markov models of molecular kinetics, or spatial disorder can give rise to memory and non-exponential distributions of waiting times and first-passage statistics. However, existing methods for analyzing CTRWs on complex energy landscapes do not address these effects. We therefore use statistical mechanics of the nonequilibrium path ensemble to characterize first-passage CTRWs on networks with arbitrary connectivity, energy landscape, and waiting time distributions. Our approach is valuable for calculating higher moments (beyond the mean) of path statistics such as path length, time, and action, as well as any conservative or nonconservative force along a path. For homogeneous networks we derive exact relations between these moments, quantifying the validity of approximating a continuous-time process (path times) with its discrete-time projection (path lengths). For more general models we obtain recursion relations, reminiscent of transfer matrix and exact enumeration techniques, to calculate path statistics numerically in an efficient way. We have implemented our recursive algorithm in PathMAN, a Python script that users can easily apply to their model of choice. We demonstrate the algorithm on a few representative examples to show the importance of non-exponential distributions, memory, and coarse-graining in CTRWs.},

@article{Au2001,
abstract = {A new simulation approach, called 'subset simulation', is proposed to compute small failure probabilities encountered in reliability analysis of engineering systems. The basic idea is to express the failure probability as a product of larger conditional failure probabilities by introducing intermediate failure events. With a proper choice of the conditional events, the conditional failure probabilities can be made sufficiently large so that they can be estimated by means of simulation with a small number of samples. The original problem of calculating a small failure probability, which is computationally demanding, is reduced to calculating a sequence of conditional probabilities, which can be readily and efficiently estimated by means of simulation. The conditional probabilities cannot be estimated efficiently by a standard Monte Carlo procedure, however, and so a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique based on the Metropolis algorithm is presented for their estimation. The proposed method is robust to the number of uncertain parameters and efficient in computing small probabilities. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by calculating the first-excursion probabilities for a linear oscillator subjected to white noise excitation and for a five-story nonlinear hysteretic shear building under uncertain seismic excitation. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Crude Monte-Carlo or quasi Monte-Carlo methods are well suited to characterize events of which associated probabilities are not too low with respect to the simulation budget. For very seldom observed events, such as the collision probability between two aircraft in airspace, these approaches do not lead to accurate results. Indeed, the number of available samples is often insufficient to estimate such low probabilities (at least 106samples are needed to estimate a probability of order 10-4with 10{\%} relative error with Monte-Carlo simulations). In this article, one reviewed different appropriate techniques to estimate rare event probabilities that require a fewer number of samples. These methods can be divided into four main categories: parameterization techniques of probability density function tails, simulation techniques such as importance sampling or importance splitting, geometric methods to approximate input failure space and finally, surrogate modeling. Each technique is detailed, its advantages and drawbacks are described and a synthesis that aims at giving some clues to the following question is given: "which technique to use for which problem?".},

abstract = {Although importance sampling is an established and effective sampling and estimation technique, it becomes unstable and unreliable for high-dimensional problems. The main reason is that the likelihood ratio in the importance sampling estimator degenerates when the dimension of the problem becomes large. Various remedies to this problem have been sug-gested, including heuristics such as resampling. Even so, the consensus is that for large-dimensional problems, likelihood ratios (and hence im-portance sampling) should be avoided. In this paper we introduce a new adaptive simulation approach that does away with likelihood ratios, while retaining the multi-level approach of the cross-entropy method. Like the latter, the method can be used for rare-event probability estimation, op-timization, and counting. Moreover, the method allows one to sample ex-actly from the target distribution rather than asymptotically as in Markov chain Monte Carlo. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for a variety of applications.},

abstract = {Let X be a time-homogeneous Markov chain on state space S with transition probability matrix P. For each j ∈ S, we can define the first hitting time to state j after n = 0, as H j inf{\{}n ∈ N : X n = j{\}}. For each n ∈ N, we can write the probability of first visit to state j at time n from the initial state i, as f (n) i j P(H j = n|X 0 = i). The probability that the Markov chain X hits state j eventually, starting from initial state i is f i j P(H j {\textless} ∞|X 0 = i) = P(∪ n∈N {\{}H j = n{\}}|X 0 = i) = ∑ n∈N P(H j = n|X 0 = i) = ∑ n∈N f (n) i j. The distribution ((f (n) i j : n ∈ N), 1 − f i j) is called the first passage time distribution for hitting state j from initial state i. The distribution ((f (n) ii : n ∈ N), 1 − f ii) is called the first recurrence time distribution for return to initial state i. A state is called recurrent if f ii = 1, and is called transient if f ii {\textless} 1. For a recurrent state i ∈ S, we can defined mean recurrence time as µ ii ∑ n∈N n f (n) ii. If the mean recurrence time for a recurrent state i is finite then the state i is called positive recurrent, and null recurrent otherwise. We would donate the conditional probability and conditional expectation of a measurable event A starting from state i as P i (A) P(A|{\{}X 0 = i{\}}), E i 1 A E[1 A |{\{}X 0 = i{\}}]. Proposition 1.1. The total number of visits to a state j ∈ S after starting from initial state i is denoted by N j = ∑ n∈N 1{\{}X n = j{\}}. Then, for each m ∈ N 0 , we have P i {\{}N j = m{\}} = 1 − f i j , m = 0, f i j f m−1 j j (1 − f j j), m ∈ N. Proof. Conditioned on X 0 = i, the first passage time H j to state j being finite is a Bernoulli random variable with probability f i j. The time of the mth return to the state j is a recurrence time for each m ∈ N 0. From strong Markov property, each return to state j is independent of the past. Hence, each return to state j in a finite time is an iid Bernoulli random variable with probability f j j. It follows that the number of recurrences to state j is the time for first failure to return. Conditioned on initial state being X 0 = j, the distribution of N j is geometric random variable with success probability 1 − f j j. Proof. Another way to see this, is to consider P i (N j {\textgreater} m). Let H (k) j be the kth hitting time of state j, then P i (N j {\textgreater} m) = ∑ n 1 ,n 2 ,...,n m ∈N P i (H (1) j = n 1)P j (H (2) j = n 2). .. P j (H (m) j = n m) = f i j f m−1 j j. Corollary 1.2. The mean number of visits to state j, starting from a state i is E i N j = f i j 1− f j j , f j j {\textless} 1, ∞, f j j = 1.},

We use a load-balanced, distributed implementation to find the Laplace transform of the first passage time density and its derivatives at arbitrary values of the transform parameter s. Setting s =0 yields moments while the full passage time distribution is obtained using a novel distributed Laplace transform inverter based on the Laguerre method. We validate our method against a variety of simple densi- ties, cycle time densities in certain overtake-free (tree-like) queue- ing networks and a simulated Petri net model. Our implementation is thereby rigorously validated and has already been applied to sub- stantial Markov chains with over 1 million states.

The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.},

Folding of large RNAs often is trapped by the need to undo misfolded structures, which precludes the study of the other, potentially more interesting aspects in the rate-limiting step, such as conformational search, metal ion binding, and the role of productive intermediates. The catalytic domain of the Bacillus subtilis RNase P RNA folds without a kinetic trap, thereby providing an ideal system to elucidate these steps. We analyzed the folding kinetics by using fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopies, catalytic activity, and synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering. Folding begins with the rapid formation of early intermediates wherein the majority of conformational search occurs, followed by the slower formation of subsequent intermediates. Before the rate-limiting step, more than 98{\%} of the total structure has formed. The rate-limiting step is a small-scale structural rearrangement involving prebound metal ions.},

abstract = {Biological mixtures such as the cytosol may consist of thousands of distinct components. There is now a substantial body of evidence showing that, under physiological conditions, intracellular mixtures can phase separate into spatially distinct regions with differing compositions. In this article we present numerical evidence indicating that such spontaneous compartmentalization exploits general features of the phase diagram of a multicomponent biomolecular mixture. In particular, we show that demixed domains are likely to segregate when the variance in the intermolecular interaction strengths exceeds a well-defined threshold. Multiple distinct phases are likely to become stable under very similar conditions, which can then be tuned to achieve multiphase coexistence. As a result, only minor adjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the intermolecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different domains with specific compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust mechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this functionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in the system. Our model therefore suggests that, for purely physico-chemical reasons, biological mixtures are naturally poised to undergo a small number of demixing phase transitions.},

abstract = {Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) methods have become widely adopted in estimating protein-ligand binding affinities due to their efficiency and high correlation with experiment. Here different computational alternatives were investigated to assess their impact to the agreement of MMPBSA calculations with experiment. Seven receptor families with both high-quality crystal structures and binding affinities were selected. First the performance of nonpolar solvation models was studied and it was found that the modern approach that separately models hydrophobic and dispersion interactions dramatically reduces RMSD's of computed relative binding affinities. The numerical setup of the Poisson-Boltzmann methods was analyzed next. The data shows that the impact of grid spacing to the quality of MMPBSA calculations is small: the numerical error at the grid spacing of 0.5 {\AA} is already small enough to be negligible. The impact of different atomic radius sets and different molecular surface definitions was further analyzed and weak influences were found on the agreement with experiment. The influence of solute dielectric constant was also analyzed: a higher dielectric constant generally improves the overall agreement with experiment, especially for highly charged binding pockets. The data also showed that the converged simulations caused slight reduction in the agreement with experiment. Finally the direction of estimating absolute binding free energies was briefly explored. Upon correction of the binding-induced rearrangement free energy and the binding entropy lost, the errors in absolute binding affinities were also reduced dramatically when the modern nonpolar solvent model was used, although further developments were apparently necessary to further improve the MMPBSA methods. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Time series data provided by single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments offer the opportunity to infer not only model parameters describing molecular complexes, e.g., rate constants, but also information about the model itself, e.g., the number of conformational states. Resolving whether such states exist or how many of them exist requires a careful approach to the problem of model selection, here meaning discrimination among models with differing numbers of states. The most straightforward approach to model selection generalizes the common idea of maximum likelihood-selecting the most likely parameter values-to maximum evidence: selecting the most likely model. In either case, such an inference presents a tremendous computational challenge, which we here address by exploiting an approximation technique termed variational Bayesian expectation maximization. We demonstrate how this technique can be applied to temporal data such as smFRET time series; show superior statistical consistency relative to the maximum likelihood approach; compare its performance on smFRET data generated from experiments on the ribosome; and illustrate how model selection in such probabilistic or generative modeling can facilitate analysis of closely related temporal data currently prevalent in biophysics.

abstract = {Mutations in a microbial population can increase the frequency of a genotype not only by increasing its exponential growth rate, but also by decreasing its lag time or adjusting the yield (resource efficiency). The contribution of multiple life-history traits to selection is a critical question for evolutionary biology as we seek to predict the evolutionary fates of mutations. Here we use a model of microbial growth to show there are two distinct components of selection corresponding to the growth and lag phases, while the yield modulates their relative importance. The model predicts rich population dynamics when there are tradeoffs between phases: multiple strains can coexist or exhibit bistability due to frequency-dependent selection, and strains can engage in rock-paper-scissors interactions due to non-transitive selection. We characterize the environmental conditions and patterns of traits necessary to realize these phenomena, which we show to be readily accessible to experiments. Our results provide a theoretical framework for analyzing high-throughput measurements of microbial growth traits, especially interpreting the pleiotropy and correlations between traits across mutants. This work also highlights the need for more comprehensive measurements of selection in simple microbial systems, where the concept of an ordinary fitness landscape breaks down.},

However, the role and contribution of molecular biophysics to these observations remain unclear. Here, we couple robust findings from protein biophysics, enzymatic flux theory, the selection against the cytotoxic effects of protein misfolding, and explicit population dynamics simulations in the polyclonal regime. First, we recapitulate results on the dynamics of clonal interference and on the shape of the DFE, thus providing them with a molecular and mechanistic foundation. Second, we predict that if evolution is indeed under the dynamic equilibrium of mutation-selection balance, the fraction of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations is almost equal among single-nucleotide polymorphisms segregating at high allele frequencies. This prediction is proven true for polymorphisms in the human coding region. Overall, our results show how selection for protein folding stability predominantly shapes the patterns of polymorphisms in coding regions.},

We introduce a biophysical fitness landscape for these phases, showing how they depend on molecular and cellular properties of Adk. We find that Adk catalytic capacity in the cell (the product of activity and abundance) is the major determinant of muta- tional fitness effects. We show that bacterial lag times are at a well-defined optimum with respect to Adk's catalytic capacity, while exponential growth rates are only weakly affected by variation in Adk. Direct pairwise competitions between strains show how environmental conditions modulate the outcome of a competition where growth rates and lag times have a tradeoff, shed- ding light on the multidimensional nature of fitness and its importance in the evolutionary optimization of enzymes.},

abstract = {AbstractShould the tape of life be replayed, would it produce similar living beings? A classical answer has long been ‘no', but accumulating data are now challenging this view. Repeatability in experimental evolution, in phenotypic evolution of diverse species and in the genes underlying phenotypic evolution indicates that despite unpredictability at the level of basic evolutionary processes (such as apparition of mutations), a certain kind of predictability can emerge at higher levels over long time periods. For instance, a survey of the alleles described in the literature that cause non-deleterious phenotypic differences among animals, plants and yeasts indicates that similar phenotypes have often evolved in distinct taxa through independent mutations in the same genes. Does this mean that the range of possibilities for evolution is limited? Does this mean that we can predict the outcomes of a replayed tape of life? Imagining other possible paths for evolution runs into four important issues: (i) resolving the influence of contingency, (ii) imagining living organisms that are different from the ones we know, (iii) finding the relevant concepts for predicting evolution, and (iv) estimating the probability of occurrence for complex evolutionary events that occurred only once during the evolution of life on earth.},

TPT gives properties such as the probability distribution of the reactive trajectories, their probability current and flux, and their rate of occurrence and the dominant reaction pathways. In this paper the framework of TPT for Markov chains is developed in detail, and the relation of the theory to electric resistor network theory and data analysis tools such as Laplacian eigenmaps and diffusion maps is discussed as well. Various algorithms for the numerical calculation of the various objects in TPT are also introduced. Finally, the theory and the algorithms are illustrated in several examples.},

abstract = {Given two metastable states A and B of a biomolecular system, the problem is to calculate the likely paths of the transition from A to B. Such a calculation is more informative and more manageable if done for a reduced set of collective variables chosen so that paths cluster in collective variable space. The computational task becomes that of computing the "center" of such a cluster. A good way to define the center employs the concept of a committor, whose value at a point in collective variable space is the probability that a trajectory at that point will reach B before A. The committor "foliates" the transition region into a set of isocommittors. The maximum flux transition path is defined as a path that crosses each isocommittor at a point which (locally) has the highest crossing rate of distinct reactive trajectories. (This path is different from that of the MaxFlux method of Huo and Straub.) It is argued that such a path is nearer to an ideal path than others that have been proposed with the possible exception of the finite-temperature string method path. To make the calculation tractable, three approximations are introduced, yielding a path that is the solution of a nonsingular two-point boundary-value problem. For such a problem, one can construct a simple and robust algorithm. One such algorithm and its performance is discussed.},

abstract = {Given two metastable states A and B of a biomolecular system, the problem is to calculate the likely paths of the transition from A to B. Such a calculation is more informative and more manageable if done for a reduced set of collective variables chosen so that paths cluster in collective variable space. The computational task becomes that of computing the "center" of such a cluster. A good way to define the center employs the concept of a committor, whose value at a point in collective variable space is the probability that a trajectory at that point will reach B before A. The committor "foliates" the transition region into a set of isocommittors. The maximum flux transition path is defined as a path that crosses each isocommittor at a point which (locally) has the highest crossing rate of distinct reactive trajectories. (This path is different from that of the MaxFlux method of Huo and Straub.) It is argued that such a path is nearer to an ideal path than others that have been proposed with the possible exception of the finite-temperature string method path. To make the calculation tractable, three approximations are introduced, yielding a path that is the solution of a nonsingular two-point boundary-value problem. For such a problem, one can construct a simple and robust algorithm. One such algorithm and its performance is discussed.},

abstract = {A central goal of protein-folding theory is to predict the stochastic dynamics of transition paths --- the rare trajectories that transit between the folded and unfolded ensembles --- using only thermodynamic information, such as a low-dimensional equilibrium free-energy landscape. However, commonly used one-dimensional landscapes typically fall short of this aim, because an empirical coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient has to be fit to transition-path trajectory data in order to reproduce the transition-path dynamics. We show that an alternative, first-principles free-energy landscape predicts transition-path statistics that agree well with simulations and single-molecule experiments without requiring dynamical data as an input. This 'topological configuration' model assumes that distinct, native-like substructures assemble on a timescale that is slower than native-contact formation but faster than the folding of the entire protein. Using only equilibrium simulation data to determine the free energies of these coarse-grained intermediate states, we predict a broad distribution of transition-path transit times that agrees well with the transition-path durations observed in simulations. We further show that both the distribution of finite-time displacements on a one-dimensional order parameter and the ensemble of transition-path trajectories generated by the model are consistent with the simulated transition paths. These results indicate that a landscape based on transient folding intermediates, which are often hidden by one-dimensional projections, can form the basis of a predictive model of protein-folding transition-path dynamics.},

abstract = {Multiple phenotypic states often arise in a single cell with different gene-expression states that undergo transcription regulation with positive feedback. Recent experiments have shown that at least in E. coli, the gene state switching can be neither extremely slow nor exceedingly rapid as many previous theoretical treatments assumed. Rather it is in the intermediate region which is difficult to handle mathematically.Under this condition, from a full chemical-master-equation description we derive a model in which the protein copy-number, for a given gene state, follow a deterministic mean-field description while the protein synthesis rates fluctuate due to stochastic gene-state switching. The simplified kinetics yields a nonequilibrium landscape function, which, similar to the energy function for equilibrium fluctuation, provides the leading orders of fluctuations around each phenotypic state, as well as the transition rates between the two phenotypic states. This rate formula is analogous to Kramers theory for chemical reactions. The resulting behaviors are significantly different from the two limiting cases studied previously.},

abstract = {The relationship between the dynamics of a community and its constituent pairwise interactions is a fundamental problem in ecology. Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and the champion of all pairwise competitions may not dominate in a mixed community. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations due to pleiotropy and non-genetic variation, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.},

abstract = {p13suc1 has two native states, a monomer and a domain-swapped dimer. We show that their folding pathways are connected by the denatured state, which introduces a kinetic barrier between monomer and dimer under native conditions. The barrier is lowered under conditions that speed up unfolding, thereby allowing, to our knowledge for the first time, a quantitative dissection of the energetics of domain swapping. The monomer-dimer equilibrium is controlled by two conserved prolines in the hinge loop that connects the exchanging domains. These two residues exploit backbone strain to specifically direct dimer formation while preventing higher-order oligomerization. Thus, the loop acts as a loaded molecular spring that releases tension in the monomer by adopting its alternative conformation in the dimer. There is an excellent correlation between domain swapping and aggregation, suggesting they share a common mechanism. These insights have allowed us to redesign the domain-swapping propensity of suc1 from a fully monomeric to a fully dimeric protein.},

@article{Qian2001,
abstract = {Global surveys of genomes measure the usage of essential molecular parts, defined here as protein families, superfamilies or folds, in different organisms. Based on surveys of the first 20 completely sequenced genomes, we observe that the occurrence of these parts follows a power-law distribution. That is, the number of distinct parts (F) with a given genomic occurrence (V) decays as F = aV-b, with a few parts occurring many times and most occurring infrequently. For a given organism, the distributions of families, superfamilies and folds are nearly identical, and this is reflected in the size of the decay exponent b. Moreover, the exponent varies between different organisms, with those of smaller genomes displaying a steeper decay (i.e. larger b). Clearly, the power law indicates a preference to duplicate genes that encode for molecular parts which are already common. Here, we present a minimal, but biologically meaningful model that accurately describes the observed power law. Although the model performs equally well for all three protein classes, we focus on the occurrence of folds in preference to families and superfamilies. This is because folds are comparatively insensitive to the effects of point mutations that can cause a family member to diverge beyond detectable similarity. In the model, genomes evolve through two basic operations: (i) duplication of existing genes; (ii) net flow of new genes. The flow term is closely related to the exponent b and can accommodate considerable gene loss; however, we demonstrate that the observed data is reproduced best with a net inflow, i.e. with more gene gain than loss. Moreover, we show that prokaryotes have much higher rates of gene acquisition than eukaryotes, probably reflecting lateral transfer. A further natural outcome from our model is an estimation of the fold composition of the initial genome, which potentially relates to the common ancestor for modern organisms.

The newly discovered viruses appear in every family or genus of RNA virus associated with vertebrate infection, including those containing human pathogens such as influenza virus, the Arenaviridae and Filoviridae families, and have branching orders that broadly reflected the phylogenetic history of their hosts. We establish a long evolutionary history for most groups of vertebrate RNA virus, and support this by evaluating evolutionary timescales using dated orthologous endogenous virus elements. We also identify new vertebrate-specific RNA viruses and genome architectures, and re-evaluate the evolution of vector-borne RNA viruses.

This trend is quantitatively explained by the prevailing model of sequence evolution based on minimizing the fitness cost of protein unfolding and aggregation. The genes with the highest epistasis are also functionally involved in the maintenance of proteostasis, translation and central metabolism. In contrast, genes evolving with low epistasis mainly encode for membrane proteins and are involved in transport activity.

abstract = {Mutations create the genetic diversity on which selective pressures can act, yet also create structural instability in proteins. How, then, is it possible for organisms to ameliorate mutation-induced perturbations of protein stability while maintaining biological fitness and gaining a selective advantage? Here we used site-specific chromosomal mutagenesis to introduce a selected set of mostly destabilizing mutations into folA--an essential chromosomal gene of Escherichia coli encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)--to determine how changes in protein stability, activity, and abundance affect fitness. In total, 27 E. coli strains carrying mutant DHFR were created. We found no significant correlation between protein stability and its catalytic activity nor between catalytic activity and fitness in a limited range of variation of catalytic activity observed in mutants. The stability of these mutants is strongly correlated with their intracellular abundance, suggesting that protein homeostatic machinery plays an active role in maintaining intracellular concentrations of proteins. Fitness also shows a significant correlation with intracellular abundance of soluble DHFR in cells growing at 30 °C. At 42 °C, the picture was mixed, yet remarkable: A few strains carrying mutant DHFR proteins aggregated, rendering them nonviable, but, intriguingly, the majority exhibited fitness higher than wild type. We found that mutational destabilization of DHFR proteins in E. coli is counterbalanced at 42 °C by their soluble oligomerization, thereby restoring structural stability and protecting against aggregation.},
