abstract = {Barrier trees consisting of local minima and their connecting saddle points imply a natural coarse-graining for the description of the energy landscape of RNA secondary structures. Here we show that, based on this approach, it is possible to predict the folding behavior of RNA molecules by numerical integration. Comparison with stochastic folding simulations shows reasonable agreement of the resulting folding dynamics and a drastic increase in computational efficiency that makes it possible to investigate the folding dynamics of RNA of at least tRNA size. Our approach is readily applicable to bistable RNA molecules and promises to facilitate studies on the dynamic behavior of RNA switches.},

abstract = {RNA secondary structure folding kinetics is known to be important for the biological function of certain processes, such as the hok/sok system in E. coli. Although linear algebra provides an exact computational solution of secondary structure folding kinetics with respect to the Turner energy model for tiny (â‰ˆ 20 nt) RNA sequences, the folding kinetics for larger sequences can only be approximated by binning structures into macrostates in a coarse-grained model, or by repeatedly simulating secondary structure folding with either the Monte Carlo algorithm or the Gillespie algorithm. Here we investigate the relation between the Monte Carlo algorithm and the Gillespie algorithm. We prove that asymptotically, the expected time for a K-step trajectory of the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to N times that of the Gillespie algorithm, where N denotes the Boltzmann expected network degree. If the network is regular (i.e. every node has the same degree), then the mean first passage time (MFPT) computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to MFPT computed by the Gillespie algorithm multiplied by N ; however, this is not true for non-regular networks. In particular, RNA secondary structure folding kinetics, as computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm, is not equal to the folding kinetics, as computed by the Gillespie algorithm, although the mean first passage times are roughly correlated. Simulation software for RNA secondary structure folding according to the Monte Carlo and Gille-spie algorithms is publicly available, as is our software to compute the expected degree of the network of secondary structures of a given RNA sequence-see http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clote/ RNAexpNumNbors.},

@techreport{Bayegan,
abstract = {Background: Existent programs for RNA folding kinetics, such as Kinefold, Kinfold and KFOLD, implement the Gillespie algorithm to generate stochastic folding trajectories from an initial structure s to a target structure t, in which each intermediate secondary structure is obtained from its predecessor by the application of a move from a given move set. The Kinfold move set M S1 [resp. M S2] allows the addition or removal [resp. addition, removal or shift] of a single base pair. Define the M S1 [resp. M S2] distance between secondary structures s and t to be the minimum path length to refold s to t, where a move from M S1 [resp. M S2] is applied in each step. The M S1 distance between s and t is trivially equal to the cardinality of the symmetric difference of s and t, i.e the number of base pairs belonging to one structure but not the other; in contrast, the computation of M S2 distance is highly non-trivial. Results: We describe algorithms to compute the shortest M S2 folding trajectory between any two given RNA secondary structures. These algorithms include an optimal integer programming (IP) algorithm, an accurate and efficient near-optimal algorithm, a greedy algorithm, a branch-and-bound algorithm, and an optimal algorithm if one allows intermediate structures to contain pseudoknots. A 10-fold slower version of our IP algorithm appeared in WABI 2017; the current version exploits special treatment of closed 2-cycles. Our optimal IP [resp. near-optimal IP] algorithm maximizes [resp. approximately maximizes] the number of shifts and minimizes [resp. approximately minimizes] the number of base pair additions and removals by applying integer programming to (essentially) solve the minimum feedback vertex set (FVS) problem for the RNA conflict digraph, then applies topological sort to tether subtrajectories into the final optimal folding trajectory. We prove NP-hardness of the problem to determine the minimum barrier energy over all possible M S2 folding pathways, and conjecture that computing the M S2 distance between arbitrary secondary structures is NP-hard. Since our optimal IP algorithm relies on the FVS, known to be NP-complete for arbitrary digraphs, we compare the family of RNA conflict digraphs with the following classes of digraphs-planar, reducible flow graph, Eulerian, and tournament-for which FVS is known to be either polynomial time computable or NP-hard. Conclusion: This paper describes a number of optimal and near-optimal algorithms to compute the shortest M S2 folding trajectory between any two secondary structures.

abstract = {We describe a conceptual framework for understanding the way large RNA molecules fold based on the notion that their free-energy landscape is rugged. A key prediction of our theory is that RNA folding can be described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism (KPM). According to KPM a small fraction of molecules folds rapidly to the native state whereas the remaining fraction is kinetically trapped in a low free-energy non-native state. This model provides a unified description of the way RNA and proteins fold. Single-molecule experiments on Tetrahymena ribozyme, which directly validate our theory, are analyzed using KPM. We also describe the earliest events that occur on microsecond time scales in RNA folding. These must involve collapse of RNA molecules that are mediated by counterion-condensation. Estimates of time scales for the initial events in RNA folding are provided for the Tetrahymena ribozyme.},

abstract = {We discuss the physics of RNA as described by its secondary structure. We examine the static properties of a homogeneous RNA model that includes pairing and base stacking energies as well as entropic costs for internal loops. For large enough loop costs the model exhibits a thermal denaturation transition which we analyze in terms of the radius of gyration. We point out an inconsistency in the standard approach to RNA secondary structure prediction for large molecules. Under an external force a second-order phase transition between a globular and an extended phase takes place. A Harris-type criterion shows that sequence disorder does not affect the correlation length exponent while the other critical exponents are modified in the glass phase. However, at high temperatures, on a coarse-grained level, disordered RNA is well described by a homogeneous model. The characteristics of force-extension curves are discussed as a function of the energy parameters. We show that the force transition is always second order. A reentrance phenomenon relevant for real disordered RNA is predicted.},

abstract = {On the basis of a helix-based transition rate model, we developed a new method for sampling cotranscriptional RNA conformational ensemble and the prediction of cotranscriptional folding kinetics. Applications to E. coli. SRP RNA and pbuE riboswitch indicate that the model may provide reliable predictions for the cotranscriptional folding pathways and population kinetics. For E. coli. SRP RNA, the predicted population kinetics and the folding pathway are consistent with the SHAPE profiles in the recent cotranscriptional SHAPE-seq experiments. For the pbuE riboswitch, the model predicts the transcriptional termination efficiency as a function of the force. The theoretical results show (a) a force-induced transition from the aptamer (antiterminator) to the terminator structure and (b) the different folding pathways for the riboswitch with and without the ligand (adenine). More specifically, without adenine, the aptamer structure emerges as a short-lived kinetic transient state instead of a thermodynamically stable intermediate state. Furthermore, from the predicted extensionâˆ’time curves, the model identifies a series of conformational switches in the pulling process, where the predicted relative residence times for the different structures are in accordance with the experimental data. The model may provide a new tool for quantitative predictions of cotranscriptional folding kinetics, and results can offer useful insights into cotranscriptional folding-related RNA functions such as regulation of gene expression with riboswitches. â–  INTRODUCTION RNA molecules fold as they are transcribed. 1,2 During the cotranscriptional folding of RNA, the transcribed sequence is prone to quick folding of local structures rather than the slow formation of long-range contacts, whose formation often requires synthesis of the entire RNA chain. Therefore, nascent intermediate states formed during transcription may differ from the thermodynamically most stable structure formed in the refolding of the full-length RNA sequence. Due to the competition between the different rate processes (folding, unfolding, and chain elongation), cotranscriptional folding pathway can be sensitive to the transcription speed and transcriptional pausing (often related to RNAâˆ’protein interactions). 3âˆ’6 For example, lowering the nucleoside triphosphate concentration leads to an increase in the population of the metastable folding intermediates during the transcription of potato spindle tuber viroid RNA. 7 Rapid elongation by phage polymerase leads to inactive transcripts of col E1 RNA II and rRNA. 8,9 These kinetic intermediate structures are not static and interactions formed in the early stage of transcription can be replaced by thermodynamically more stable interactions in the later stage of the transcription. Various theories and simulations have been developed to model cotranscriptional folding. For example, kinetic Monte Carlo approach 10 has successfully predicted the formation of misfolded helices as kinetic traps in cotranscriptional RNA folding process. 11,12 Simulations using genetic algorithms have been applied to investigate the cotranscriptional folding of various RNA structures, including pseudoknots. 13,14 These studies have provided deep insights into the kinetic mechanism for the folding kinetics such as the disruption of transiently formed nascent structures during cotranscriptional process. On the basis of a map for the complete energy landscape, map-based Monte Carlo simulations can give successful predictions for folding intermediates and population kinetics for RNAs of lengths over 200 nucleotides. 15 Through sequential addition and combination of secondary structure elements, the Kinwalker model can predict the cotranscriptional kinetics for large RNAs of sequence length up to 1500 nucleotide. 16 Moreover, based on a series of kinetic simulations for the elongation steps and coarse-grained energy landscape, the BarMap method allows computation of folding kinetics through numerical integration for the growing chain. 17,18 Kinetic cluster model, an RNA folding kinetics model based on the complete conformational ensemble and the pre-equilibrated conformational macrostates, enables deterministic predictions for the population kinetics,},
